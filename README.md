# Karabiner-Elements shortcuts

Some helpful shortcuts for MacOS using [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) tool

## Keyboard brightness
There is no built-in keyboard brightness control in macOS. Add this rule to increase/decrease brightness using `command + F1/F2` keys.

Why is it not a built-in feature? Who knows...

## Instant language switch
There is a weird delay/glitch when I switch the layout using the default MacOS keyboard shortcut called "Select the previous input source". Sometimes it doesn't even work and when I type fast it really drives me crazy.
Add this rule to certainly instantly switch the input language between English and Russian using `control + spacebar` key. 

You can modify the script with your languages
